# Changelog (Docs)

The canonical changelog now lives at the repository root in `CHANGELOG.md` so release workflows and publish notes point at a single source of truth. This file remains in `docs/` to avoid broken links and to redirect readers:

- Current changelog: see `../CHANGELOG.md`
- Status docs: see `docs/ROADMAP.md` for adoption guidance and release posture

If you update release notes, edit `CHANGELOG.md` in the repository root; this file should remain a lightweight pointer.
