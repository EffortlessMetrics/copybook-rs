# Installation notes:
# 1. For basic functionality: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. For development: pip install -r requirements.txt black flake8 mypy pytest pytest-cov
# 3. For documentation: pip install -r requirements.txt sphinx sphinx-rtd-theme
# 4. Enterprise deployments may require additional packages based on integration needs

# Security considerations:
# - All dependencies are pinned to major version ranges for security
# - Regular updates should be performed to address security vulnerabilities
# - cryptography package provides enterprise-grade security features
# - Consider using pip-tools for more precise dependency management in production

# Platform compatibility:
# - These dependencies are compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows
# - Some enterprise integrations may be platform-specific
# - Tested with Python 3.8+ on major platforms

# Production deployment recommendations:
# - Use virtual environments for isolation
# - Pin exact versions for production stability
# - Regular security scanning of dependencies
# - Consider using Docker for containerized deployments
