# copybook-governance-eval

SRP microcrate for runtime governance evaluation:

- Resolves support-matrix entries against active feature flags
- Produces interoperable governance state rows and runtime summaries
- Reuses canonical governance-grid feature and support contracts

`copybook-governance-runtime` remains as the compatibility/re-export layer.
