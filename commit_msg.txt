fix(bdd): enable audit feature by default for enterprise audit scenarios

The audit step definitions in tests/bdd/steps/audit.rs are gated behind
#[cfg(feature = "audit")] in steps/mod.rs. Without the audit feature
enabled by default, these steps were not compiled, causing all 18
enterprise_audit.feature scenarios to fail with 'step not matched'.
