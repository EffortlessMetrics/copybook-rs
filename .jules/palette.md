## 2026-02-20 - Tree View for CLI Hierarchies
**Learning:** Users find flat lists of hierarchical data (like COBOL structures) hard to parse visually. Using box-drawing characters to create a tree view immediately clarifies relationships without needing additional explanation or indentation columns.
**Action:** When displaying nested data in CLI, default to tree views using standard box-drawing characters (`├`, `└`, `│`) instead of flat paths.
